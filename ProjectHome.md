TinEye provides a great Firefox extension. It adds an item to the context menu of images that allows the user to quickly and easily do a reverse image search.

The Chrome extension that TinEye provides is not as elegant. It adds a button to the users toolbar that, when clicked, attempts to display all of the images on the current page and allows the user to select one for which to perform a reverse image search. Not only is this process less-than-streamlined, the extension eats up real-estate on the toolbar.

The purpose of this project is to create an alternative TinEye extension that is feature equivalent to TinEye's Firefox extension.
